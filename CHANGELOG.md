# Changelog

All notable changes to spark-vm are recorded here, following
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The version lives in the
`VERSION` file at the repo root (see `docs/VERSIONING.md`); this file is
its human-readable companion.

## The changelog ritual

This changelog only works if entries land with the change, not after it:

1. **Every PR that changes anything user- or operator-visible adds one or
   two bullets under `## [Unreleased]`**, in the right section
   (`Added` / `Changed` / `Fixed` / `Security`). Write for the person
   running spark-vm, not the person who wrote the diff — no file paths,
   function names, or internal audit numbering — and link the PR number.
   Reviewers request changes when the entry is missing: it's a merge gate,
   not a suggestion (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
2. **Trivial scope** (typo, single-line doc fix, formatting) doesn't need an
   entry; merge notes are enough. **Seeding-batch exemption:** PRs authored
   before this ritual merged (the 2026-09-19 queue-drain batch) are exempt —
   the per-PR entry rule applies prospectively from this PR's merge.
3. **At release time**, the release commit (the `VERSION` bump — see
   `docs/VERSIONING.md`, "Cutting a release") moves the whole
   `## [Unreleased]` section into `## [0.2.0] - YYYY-MM-DD` (pattern:
   `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD`), adds the compare links in the footer
   scaffold at the bottom of this file (uncomment and fill it in), and
   leaves a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` section behind for the next PR.
4. Docs are a first-class product here, so anything merged under `docs/`
   gets an entry like a feature. Notes that never land in the repo — e.g.
   the loop's working notes in its `agent_notes/` workspace (not part of
   this repo) — don't get entries.
5. **A revert is a change too**: the revert PR gets its own entry noting
   the reversal, so the changelog reads forward in time.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- First test suites for the two remaining untested components (O4): `cua/`
  gets hermetic tests for the `cua-bridge.py` localhost bridge — launch
  allowlist enforcement, the CSRF/host gate, window picking, and the
  click/type/key/launch endpoints (including the desktop→window coordinate
  mapping and the panel global-click branch) — plus syntax/shebang checks
  for the `cua/bin` shell scripts; `jail/` gets a hermetic smoke test for
  `build.sh` pinning its strict mode, idempotency guards, and the jail's
  documented isolation properties (no bind mounts, no DNS, proxy-only
  nftables egress, explicit UID range, sshd hardening, swapd CA temp
  cleanup). Both suites are wired into the CI `python-tests` job.
- Stopped/cold retention tier thinking (C15): the hosted pricing thinking
  now names the stopped-state cost story the live-control deep scan found
  missing — a published $0.000027/GB-hour cold-storage anchor (≈$0.79/mo
  for a stopped 40 GB box), running-only billing precedent, and the
  control-plane→billing contract the H4 provider interface already ships.
  Thinking only; no pricing-page row until the Billing decision lands.
- Waitlist 30-day post-drop purge: `waitlist_jobs.py --purge` permanently
  deletes dropped waitlist rows 30 days after the drop (the §5 retention
  rule), via an atomic `rows.jsonl` rewrite under the same data lock as
  the reminder/drop jobs — the funnel events stay as the audit trail.
- H4 provider interface contract: the provider-agnostic driver every
  sandbox backend implements, reconciling the H3 signup design, the
  suspend/wake and Fly/GPU provider research, and the #47 lifecycle
  audit into one buildable target — six verbs (provision, status,
  suspend, wake-on-dial, ssh_info, destroy; snapshot reserved), a validated box
  lifecycle state machine, per-shape suspend capability flags, a
  billing-facing disk-retention descriptor for idle/stopped boxes, and
  a fail-closed no-public-ingress rule the control plane verifies after
  provisioning. Park-style backends (RunPod's "suspend" is park) are
  representable via the `wake_reprovisions` capability flag and the
  `wake_kind` resume-path surface, and the per-`vm_id` lifecycle is marked
  provisional on H11's isolation-shape answer ([#183](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/pull/183)).
- README "What's in the box" names the human-approval loop (`confirmd`)
  alongside the proxy/job-runner/desktop/cred-UI stack, and the repo
  layout table now lists `deploy/`, `harness/`, `site/`, `assets/`, and
  the `VERSION`/`CHANGELOG.md`/`CONTRIBUTING.md` process files (#182).
- Lifecycle parity audit for the #47 live-machine-control ticket: #47's
  promised-vs-accepted lifecycle surface checked against the six-provider
  live-control scorecard. Found pause/resume promised in the ticket but
  missing from its acceptance criteria, undefined stream-ownership
  semantics for the live desktop, no idle lifecycle policy model, and an
  undecided stopped-state/file-browsing scope — filed as #177, #178, #179,
  and #180. Also closes the deep-scan's unscored file-browsing and restart
  columns.
- Release and branch protection declared as code (`deploy/rulesets/`): a
  `v*` tag ruleset that makes the release notes' "tags are never moved or
  re-cut" claim platform-enforced (blocks tag update/deletion, with a
  stricter variant that also restricts tag creation to the release
  workflow), plus a `main` branch ruleset (no deletion, no force-pushes,
  PR-required, all CI checks green on an up-to-date branch before merge —
  deliberately no human-approval gate so the improvement loop can keep
  self-merging). An auditable `scripts/apply-rulesets.sh` (dry-run default,
  `--check` drift compare, `--execute --yes` idempotent apply) applies them;
  applying is an owner decision (#174)

### Fixed
- README, ONBOARDING, and the pre-seeded-harness research doc now point at
  the real `cua/bin/cua-desktop.sh` path (the script moved into `cua/bin/`
  and the old `./cua/cua-desktop.sh` reference broke the desktop step of
  the copy-paste install block) (#182).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added
- A docs index for the docs tree (`docs/README.md`): the 40-plus doc corpus
  organized by what you're trying to do — start-here contributor picks,
  hosted-product design specs, the product-research corpus, the dated
  competitor corpus, and loop governance, with a keep-this-index-honest rule
  for new docs; the root README's repo-layout table links to it (#171)
- Live-control competitor deep-scan for the #47 control-plane design: six
  providers (AgentComputer, TermSquad, Fly.io Sprites, E2B, Daytona, Docker
  Sandboxes) scored on browser desktop streaming, live terminal,
  suspend/wake, and transport, with where-we-win/lag findings feeding three
  new backlog items — the #47 resume-latency target (C14), the stopped/cold
  cost tier for hosted pricing (C15), and the control-plane-visible lifecycle
  parity audit (C16) (#168)
- Waitlist page build, slice 2: the waitlist service backend — the form
  endpoint (honeypot and timing-trap defenses that accept spam silently,
  per-IP rate limiting, email normalization and dedup), the double-opt-in
  confirm flow (render-only link page, one-click confirm, single-use
  HMAC-signed tokens with 14-day expiry, the 3-per-day email cap), and
  funnel-event logging the metrics script already consumes. The operator
  key and data dir come from environment variables, never the repo. Still
  not deployable: reminder/drop jobs, the email-parsing path, invites,
  and forget-me land next; the page ships only when the full
  waitlist-operations checklist is green (#165)
- Waitlist page build, slice 3a: the waitlist lifecycle jobs — one reminder
  email at +7 days (the last touch; there is no third email) and automatic
  drop of unconfirmed rows at 14 days, run as operator cron jobs with a
  cross-process lock so they never race the live service. The drop deadline
  is fixed at first signup and never postponed by re-signups. Oversized
  requests now close the HTTP connection instead of risking a desynced
  keep-alive. Still not deployable: the email-parsing path, invites, and
  forget-me land next; the page ships only when the full
  waitlist-operations checklist is green (#172)
- Browser-driver first code (H17, [#132](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/issues/132)):
  the fixed `bdrive` action protocol as validated Python — the narrow action
  vocabulary the on-box browser service will accept, with ref-scoped element
  locators, receipt semantics, and hermetic tests. Deferred to later slices:
  the Chromium execution backend, the daemon socket, box hardening, the
  `obox` agent loop, and the card pathway + Web Push (#166)
- Waitlist page build, slice 1: the static front end of the waitlist-era web
  surface — the landing page typeset from the approved launch copy, a
  dedicated `/waitlist` form page with the abuse-resistant signup form
  (owner email, optional agent contact, honeypot and timing defenses, no
  page JavaScript), and a derived social-card image reused from the shipped
  demo asset. **Not deployable yet:** the form's backend (signup endpoint,
  confirm flow, invite jobs) comes next, and the page ships only when the
  full waitlist-operations checklist is green
  ([#163](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/pull/163))
- Build-update template and cadence contract for Spark's daily spark-vm updates
  on musebook.lol: `docs/MUSEBOOK_UPDATES.md` defines the template, the honesty
  rules (no hosted-launch or pricing commitments until the launch is
  executable), and a sample post
  ([#162](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/pull/162))
- Funnel query pack for the waitlist operator: a log-derived, no-cookie,
  no-tracker weekly report (page conversion, CTA click-through by section,
  interim raw vs DMARC-aligned confirm rate with the manufactured-row spray
  signature, reminder lift, invite-to-claim, submit-to-confirm latency) —
  the §7 deliverable of the funnel measurement spec
  ([#141](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/pull/141))
- Changelog ritual: this `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep a Changelog format), the
  per-PR entry requirement in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and release-time rollover
  in `docs/VERSIONING.md`
  ([#65](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/pull/65))
- Approval pages rebuilt mobile-friendly: the pending list auto-refreshes,
  Approve is a two-tap confirm safe against double-taps, and the answered
  page keeps the 100 most recent ([#20](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/pull/20),
  fixes [#1](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/issues/1))
- Push notifications for approvals: get a push on your phone/desktop when an
  approval is pending; the operator generates one keypair, you subscribe on
  the pending page, and `--test-push` verifies delivery end to end
  ([#48](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/pull/48), closes
  [#2](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/issues/2))
- One version everywhere: every component now reports the same `VERSION` —
  `confirmd` and `cred-ui` at startup and on `/api/version`, `muse-job
  --version` — so an operator can always answer "what's actually deployed?"
  ([#52](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/pull/52))
- Unattended redeploy updater: merged code reaches the live services on its
  own, with the deployed version recorded in the audit log and rollback
  covered ([#29](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/pull/29), fixes
  [#22](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/issues/22))
- `muse-job` hardened against hostile agent output: session-lifecycle trust
  boundary ([#43](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/pull/43)) and
  event-trust hardening ([#19](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/pull/19),
  fixes [#3](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/issues/3))
- Control-panel spec so anyone can build their own computer-control panel,
  with a worked Blender example; the bridge allows the SSH-forwarded tunnel
  endpoint ([`811920b`](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/commit/811920b),
  [`57f24f5`](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/commit/57f24f5),
  [`fc06cbb`](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/commit/fc06cbb))

  the provider decision ([#40](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/pull/40));

  copy ([#36](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/pull/36)); README
  30-second-scan clarity pass ([#46](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/pull/46))
- Contributor hygiene: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`
  ([#58](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/pull/58)), MIT `LICENSE`
  ([`52960f0`](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/commit/52960f0))
- Fly.io driver research for H4: grounds the provider-agnostic provisioning
  interface and planned contract extensions (suspend/wake, async dial,
  gpu_class routing, destroy-deletes-volumes) against the real Machines API
  ([#140](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/pull/140))

### Changed
- Identity cleanup: deployment docs use the `ntindle` login account
  ([#35](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/pull/35)); separately, the
  agent itself is `spark`, and every path in the repo is `$HOME`-relative
  so docs never hardcode a username
  ([`a8fd18d`](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/commit/a8fd18d))
- README rewritten around the bigger-computer idea, with the Spark
  illustration ([`c09a65a`](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/commit/c09a65a),
  [`7e7ffea`](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/commit/7e7ffea))
- `push.sh` / `pull.sh` sync scripts: dry-run mode, preflight checks, and a
  space-safe secret scan ([#33](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/pull/33))

### Fixed
- Root deploy writes stop following symlinks in `/home/swapd`: `cp`/`tee`/
  `chown`/`chmod` on `ssrf.deny`, `grants.json`, and `swap.log` would have let
  a swapd-level attacker plant a symlink at a root-write destination and get
  the next unattended deploy to write/chown through it (same class as #91,
  fixed for the secrets dirs; the grants.json instance is #128). The new
  `proxy/safe_install.py` refuses symlinks fail-closed, creates with
  `O_EXCL`+`O_NOFOLLOW`, and `fchown`s/`fchmod`s the open fd; steps 3/4/4a of
  `proxy/deploy.sh` use it
  ([#143](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/pull/143), fixes
  [#128](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/issues/128)) Also fixes a latent grants.json wipe: the old
  existence check ran as the deploy user, so when `/home/swapd` wasn't
  traversable it always took the create branch and `sudo tee` truncated the
  file on every deploy.
- `confirmd` and its health check no longer pin the box's tailnet IP: the
  `CONFIRM_BIND` literal is gone from `confirm/confirmd.service` (the daemon
  already resolves its bind via `tailscale ip -4` at startup), and the
  updater's health entry is `tcp:TAILNET:8443`, resolved at check time. A
  tailnet rekey/IP change survives a restart instead of wedging the service
  or failing every deploy's health check (rollback of a good deploy)
  ([#143](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/pull/143))
- The updater now warns when it runs stale code: `init` records the checkout
  commit the installed copy came from, and `status`/`check` warn when
  `origin/main` carries newer `deploy/` changes not live because `init`
  wasn't re-run
  ([#143](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/pull/143))
- `muse-job` detects a dead terminal pane and refuses to steer into it
  instead of typing into the void
  ([#45](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/pull/45), fixes
  [#4](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/issues/4))
- Setup no longer teaches a shell-history-leaking secret install: the
  `cred set` examples now use the no-echo prompt (or `read -rs` when the
  no-echo prompt isn't convenient) so typed values never land in shell
  history
  ([#135](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/pull/135), fixes
  [#89](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/issues/89))

### Security
- Proxy hardening round
  ([#18](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/pull/18))
- Fixed critical and high findings from the security code review
  ([`dd382af`](https://github.com/ntindle/spark-vm/commit/dd382af))
